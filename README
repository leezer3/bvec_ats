BASIC OVERVIEW
--------------

BVEC_ATS is a BSD-Licened plugin for the OpenBVE train simulator.
This plugin aims to provide basic simulation functions for British
safety systems such as AWS & TPWS, and traction simulation for
electric, diesel and steam locomotives.

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
---------------------------

BVEC_ATS has been designed to be fully cross-platform, and supports
any operating system capable of running OpenBVE. It has been tested
on these operating systems:
* Windows 7
* Windows 8.1
* Debian Wheezy
* Ubuntu Saucy
* Ubuntu Trusty [libgdiplus / OpenBVE are broken, and require manual
  downgrading to the Saucy libgdiplus version]

MIGRATING FROM OS_ATS [DEVELOPERS & END USERS]
----------------------------------------------

End Users:
BVEC_ATS supports an automatic upgrade of an existing OS_ATS 
configuration file.
OS_ATS1.dll and OS_ATS1.cfg must be present in the same directory as BVEC_ATS.dll
[On Linux & Mac, the case of these two filenames must match]

Devlopers:
If you are migrating from OS_ATS, first allow the plugin to perform an automatic upgrade.
Whilst the form for most paramaters are identical, some differ slightly. 
Please see configuration and the online documentation for further details.
